1) Database:

MySql 5.6


Database connection:
host -> 127.0.0.1
user -> db_user
pass -> pass
db name -> car_store

JDBC driver -> mysql-connector-java-5.1.48.jar (it's fully compatible with MariaDB).
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.1.html


2) Application server:

The chosen application server is Payara (open source version of Glassfish), latest version 193
https://www.payara.fish/software/downloads/

To start the server, extract the archive to some folder on the file system.
Then open the Command Line CMD and go to folder ${PAYARA_FOLDER}\payara5\bin

Execute "asadmin start-domain" command. This will start the app server on the local host.
Admin console is available on localhost:4848, no password required.

3) Create Data Source on the Application server.
Create data source with JNDI name on the app server.
Useful resource (example how to create data source with Glassfish command line tools) - https://javaeesquad.github.io/tutorials/glassfishDatasource/glassFishDatasource.html


 Steps to setup the data source
 
 	Useful link - https://blog.payara.fish/an-intro-to-connection-pools-in-payara-server-5
 
     1) Copy the mysql-connector-java-5.1.48.jar to ${PAYARA_FOLDER}\payara5\glassfish\lib
     2) From the payara command line tools, execute the following commands:
     Open CMD and go to folder: ${PAYARA_FOLDER}\payara5\bin
     Execute then: asadmin create-jdbc-connection-pool --restype javax.sql.DataSource --datasourceclassname com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource --property "user=db_user:password=pass:url=jdbc\:mysql\://127.0.0.1\:3306/car_store" carStorePool
     
     This will create a JDBC connection pool called "carStorePool". Next thing is to define a JNDI jdbc resource, that can be found by the application.
     
     To validate that the connection pool is created and configured, execute the command:
     asaadmin ping-connection-pool carStorePool
     You should see a result "Command ping-connection-pool executed successfully."
     
     Execute another command for creating a JNDI resource:
 	 
 	 asadmin create-jdbc-resource --connectionpoolid carStorePool jdbc/carStorePool
 	 
 	 Expected output:
 	 "JDBC resource jdbc/carStorePool created successfully. Command create-jdbc-resource executed successfully."
